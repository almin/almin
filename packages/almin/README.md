# [Almin](https://github.com/almin/almin) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/almin/almin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/almin/almin)

[![Almin.js logo](https://almin.js.org/media/logo/logo.png)](https://github.com/almin/almin)

## Installation

    npm install almin

You'll also need a Promise polyfill for [older browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=promises).

    npm install es6-promise

## Usage

:memo: Please See [https://almin.js.org/](https://almin.js.org/) for details.

## What is Almin?

Almin provides Flux/CQRS patterns for JavaScript applications.

It aims to create a scalable app.

![Overview of almin-architecture](./docs/resources/almin-architecture.png)

The above figure is overview of Almin architecture that is similar to CQRS([Command Query Responsibility Segregation](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html "Command Query Responsibility Segregation")).

But, Almin is not a framework, provides only these components

- Dispatcher
- Context
- UseCase
- Store
- StoreGroup

Other components like Domain, Repository and State are written by you!

Of course, Almin help you to write other components.

Also, You may notice that these components are similar to [Flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux "Flux") architecture.

Almin is also a flux implementation library. :thumbsup:

| Almin      | Flux          | Redux                  |
|------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Dispatcher | Dispatcher    | store.dispatch         |
| Context    | Container     | Middleware/React Redux |
| UseCase    | ActionCreator | Actions                |
| Store      | Store         | Store                  |
| StoreGroup | Container     | combineReducers        |
| (State)    | Store         | Reducer                |
| (Domain)   |               |                        |
|(Repository)|               |                        |

:memo: `State`, `Domain` and `Repository` is optional on Almin,
because the best for these components is vary based on application.

Almin has not a perfect solution for an application, but we can write code thinking.

We are going to learn two architectures(Flux/CQRS) using Almin :)
