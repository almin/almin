# Counter Example

In this guide, we’ll walk through the process of creating a simple Todo app.

![counter](./img/counter.png)

## Source Code

You can get source code for counter app from here

- https://github.com/almin/almin/tree/master/example/counter

```sh
git clone https://github.com/almin/almin.git

cd almin/example/counter
npm install
npm start
# manually open
open http://localhost:8080/
```

## The purpose of counter

1. Press button and count up!

End.

## UseCase

We start implementing the UseCase.

> 1. Press button and count up!

Create `IncrementalCounterUseCase` class

```js
"use strict";
import {UseCase} from "almin"
export default class IncrementalCounterUseCase extends UseCase {
    // UseCase should implement #execute method
    execute() {
        // Write the UseCase code
    }
}
```

We want to update **counter app state**, if the `IncrementalCounterUseCase` is executed.

Simply, put **counter app state** to a **Store**.

## Store

Second, We create `CounterStore` class. 

```js
"use strict";
import {Store} from "almin";
export class CounterStore extends Store {
    constructor() {
        super();
        // receive event from UseCase, then update state
    }

    // return state object
    getState() {
        return {
            count: 0 
        }
    }
}
```

Almin's `Store` can receive the dispatched *event* from a UseCase.

:thought_balloon: Image:

1. IncrementalCounterUseCase dispatch "increment" event.
2. CounterStore receive the dispatched "increment" event and update own state.

This pattern is the same Flux architecture.

![flux-diagram-white-background](./img/flux-diagram-white-background.png)

In flux:

1. dispatch "increment" action via ActionCreator
2. Store receive "increment" action and update own state

## **UseCase** dispatch -> Store
 
Return `IncrementalCounterUseCase` and add "dispatch increment event"

[include, IncrementalCounterUseCase.js](../../example/counter/src/usecase/IncrementalCounterUseCase.js)

A class inherited `UseCase` has `this.dispatch(payload);` method.

`payload` object must have `type` property.

```js
{
    type: "type"
}
```

is a minimal payload object.

```js
{
    type : "show",
    value: "value"
}
```

So, `IncrementalCounterUseCase` dispatch "IncrementalCounterUseCase" payload.

## UseCase -> **Store** received

Previously, we created `CounterStore` that can received "IncrementalCounterUseCase" payload.

A class inherited `Store` has `this.onDispatch(function(payload){ });` method.

```js
import {Store} from "almin";
export class CounterStore extends Store {
    constructor() {
        super();
        // receive event from UseCase, then update state
        this.onDispatch(payload => {
            console.log(payload);
            /*
            {
                type: "IncrementalCounterUseCase"
            }
            */
        });
    }

    getState() {
        return {
            counterState: this.state
        }
    }
}
```

All that is updating `CounterStore`'s state!

Wait! :raised_hand:

We can separate the `state` and `CounterStore`.
It means that we can create `CounterState`.

**Store**

- Observe dispatch events and update state

**State**

- It is state!

## State

We have created `CounterState.js`.

`CounterState`s main purpose

- receive "payload" and return state.

[include, CounterState.js](../../example/counter/src/store/CounterState.js)

You may have seen the pattern...
Yes It is **reducer**!

- [Reducers | Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Reducers.html "Reducers | Redux")
- [Flux | Application Architecture for Building User Interfaces](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/flux-utils.html "Flux | Application Architecture for Building User Interfaces")

## Store -> State: NewState

Finally, we have added some code to `CounterStore`

1. Receive dispatched event, then update `CounterState`
2. if `CounterState` is updated, `CounterStore` is also changed!

A class inherited `Store` has `this.emitChange();` method.
It method is called and emit change to the subscribers(often View).

[include, CounterStore.js](../../example/counter/src/store/CounterStore.js)

### Side note: Testing

We can test above classes independently.

- [almin/example/counter/test at master · almin/almin](https://github.com/almin/almin/tree/master/example/counter/test "almin/example/counter/test at master · almin/almin")

## View Integration

This example use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/ "React").

### App

We will create `App.js` is the root of component aka. Container component.

And, create `Context` object that is communicator between Store and UseCase.

```js
import {Context, Dispatcher} from "almin";
import {CounterStore} from "../store/CounterStore";
// a single dispatcher
const dispatcher = new Dispatcher();
// a single store. if you want to use multiple, please use StoreGroup!
const store = new CounterStore();
const appContext = new Context({
    dispatcher,
    store
});
```

[include, App.js](../../example/counter/src/component/App.js)

```js
appContext.onChange(onChangeHandler);
```

If `CounterStore` is changed(`emitChange()`ed), call `onChangeHandler`.
`onChangeHandler` do update `App` component's state.

### Counter component

Counter component receive `counterState` and `appContext` via `this.props.`.

```js
CounterComponent.propTypes = {
    appContext: React.PropTypes.instanceOf(Context).isRequired,
    counterState: React.PropTypes.instanceOf(CounterState).isRequired
};
```

## End

We have created simple counter app.

Writing the pattern in this guide is the same of Flux pattern.

Next: We learn domain model and CQRS pattern while creating TodoMVC app.
