- `timeStamp`: time stamp(Unix time)
- `useCase`: What is UseCase related this?
- `dispatcher`: What UseCase dispatched this?
- `isTrusted`: Is the payload object generated by Almin?

## Dispatcher

Dispatcher is a EventEmitter-like class.

It use `dispatch(payload)`/`onDispatch((payload) => {})` instead of `on("key", ...args)`/`emit("key", ...args)`

- `onDispatch(payload, meta): Function`
